# Use name as the message digest algorithm used when signing a key. Running the 
# program with the command --version yields a list of supported algorithms. Be

# implementations do not, then some users will not be able to use the key 
# signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key.

# SHA-1 is the only algorithm specified for OpenPGP V4. By changing the 
# cert-digest-algo, the OpenPGP V4 specification is not met but with even 
# GnuPG 1.4.10 (release 2009) supporting SHA-2 algorithm, this should be safe.

# round up to the nearest legal value. This option is only meaningful if
