# you can set branch's description using command
# git branch --edit-description
# this opens the configured text editor, enter message, save and exit
# if one editor does not work (for example Sublime does not work for me)
# try another one, like vi

# you can see branch's description using
# git config branch.<branch name>.description

# example output
# $ ./branches.sh
# * master        this is master branch
# one             this is simple branch for testing
